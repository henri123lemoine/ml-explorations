# Classification of Image Data with Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks

This experiment was conducted as part of COMP551. We implement MLPs and CNNs and use them to classify image data (MNIST & STL10). We explore the impact of normalization, intializations, activations, optimizers, schedulers, and architectures on performance.
